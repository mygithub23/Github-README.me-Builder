<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Project Objective
  Eventually I think it would be nice for this app to have to same command line interface as the C-based app.

## Preject Description

We can use Inquirer for this. The module includes a number of methods for various types of prompts, which are roughly analogous to HTML form controls. In order to collect the user’s GitHub username and password, we’re going to use the input and password types respectively.
The next thing we need to do is create a function that will prompt the user for their GitHub credentials.
